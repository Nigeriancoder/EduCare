# Problem
Students with learning disabilities (LD) who wish to achieve financial and personal independence need to be able to access post-secondary education and overcome numerous academic barriers. Access to qualified counsellors, appropriate transition services, academic remediation, and accommodations may make a difference in whether or not students are able to achieve post-secondary success.

In addition, students and educators alike frequently do not understand the confusing LD label and fail to understand exactly what services/technics are appropriate. How are these high-risk students able to pursue postsecondary education successfully when there are so many undefined variables.

A learning disability (LD) is a disability that affects how an individual of average to above-average intelligence processed information (receives it, integrates it, and/or expresses it). The student with a learning disability may have language-based and/or perceptual problems that affect reading, spelling, written, language, or mathematics.

# Solution
We are building a machine and AI solution that will be deployed on Android and scale to using VR to make learning FUN for everyone that wants to learn. The solution ask few questions and will recommend which learning style best suit the recipient.

# Impact
1. Learning becomes fun
2. Everyone learn in a way that best suits them to aid assimiilation 
3. Reduced failure rate
4. Education won't be seen as a task anymore.
