# Problem
Students with learning disabilities (LD) who wish to achieve financial and personal
independence need to be able to access postsecondary education and overcome numerous academic barriers. Access to qualified counselors, appropriate transition services, academic remediation, and accommodations may make a difference to whether or not students are able to
achieve postsecondary success.

In addition, students and educators alike frequently
do not understand the confusing LD label and fail to understand exactly what services/technics are appropriate. How are these high risk students able to pursue postsecondary education successfully when there are so many undefined variables

A learning disability (LD) is a disability that effects how an individual of average to above average intelligence processed information (receives it, integrates it, and/or
expresses it). The student with a learning disability may have language based and/or perceptual problems that effect reading, spelling, written, language, or mathematics.
